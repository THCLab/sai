# Self-Addressing Identifier

A Rust implementation of the [IETF Draft SAID specification](https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html).

Self-Addressing Identifier (SAI) provides a compact text representation of digests of data.
It supports multiple hash algorithms.

Self Addressing Identifier is base64 encoded hash of data, prepended with
one or two letter prefix, called derivation code. Derivation code determines
which hash algorithm was used to derive the digest.

| derivation code| digest type 		| code length 	| identifier length	|
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| E				| Blake3-256 Digest | 1				| 44 				|
| F 			| Blake2b-256 Digest| 1				| 44				|
| G				| Blake2s-256 Digest| 1				| 44				|
| H				| SHA3-256 Digest 	| 1				| 44				|
| I				| SHA2-256 Digest	| 1				| 44				|
| 0D			| Blake3-512 Digest | 2				| 88				|
| 0E			| Blake2b-512 Digest| 2				| 88				|
| 0F			| SHA3-512 Digest 	| 2				| 88				|
| 0G			| SHA2-512 Digest	| 2				| 88				|

## Usage

To derive Self Addressing Identifier, `SelfAddressing` enum can be used. It
determines hashing algorithm used for Identifier derivation.  Here are its
possible values:

```rust
pub enum SelfAddressing {
    Blake3_256,
    Blake2B256(Vec<u8>),
    Blake2S256(Vec<u8>),
    SHA3_256,
    SHA2_256,
    Blake3_512,
    SHA3_512,
    Blake2B512,
    SHA2_512,
}
```

`verify_bindings` function checks if provided data matches digest encoded in Self Addressing Identifier.

### Example
```rust
let data = "hello there";
let sai = SelfAddressing::Blake3_256.derive(data.as_bytes());

assert_eq!(format!("{}", sai), "ENmwqnqVxonf_bNZ0hMipOJJY25dxlC8eSY5BbyMCfLJ");
assert!(sai.verify_binding(data.as_bytes()));
assert!(!sai.verify_binding("wrong data".as_bytes()));
```

## wasm
`bindings/sai_wasm` directory contains a project which allows to compile sai library to wasm.

## Releasing new version
[cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) is required

To release new version run `cargo release`

Due to [release config](./release.toml) it will bump version, create new git tag
and push it to remote.
